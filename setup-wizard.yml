      The watch-tower has no default (besides that prefilled below). Specify the networks you wish to monitor here in a comma-separated list.
      For example, to monitor Mainnet and Gnosis Chain you would specify "mainnet,gnosis".

      By default, the watch-tower will index and monitor conditional orders for all users. When running your own watch-tower, you can specify
      the addresses you wish to monitor here in a comma-separated list. For example, to monitor the addresses 0x1234 and 0x5678 you would specify
      "0x1234,0x5678". If you wish to monitor all addresses, leave this field blank.

  - title: RPC page size
    id: page
    description: >-
      When synchronizing with the blockchain, the watch-tower will request blocks in batches. By default, the watch-tower will request 5000 blocks
      at a time. If you wish to change this, specify the page size here. As this is configured to run on dappnode, against your own RPC node, you
      can set this to a very high number (e.g. 1000000).
